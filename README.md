# ðŸŒ³ Sustainable Forest Management & Carbon Calculator

## Project Purpose
This repository provides tools and metrics to support transparent and data-driven **sustainable forest management**. Our primary goal is to accurately quantify the environmental impact of forestry initiatives, particularly by estimating **carbon sequestration**.

## âœ¨ Key Feature: Carbon Calculation
The core contribution of this project is the new Python script: `carbon-calculation.py`.

### How it Contributes:
* **Metric:** It provides a formula to estimate the total carbon (in tons) sequestered by a forest stand.
* **Inputs:** The calculation is based on parameters like the number of trees, their average growth years, and an assumed biomass factor.
* **Output:** The script returns the estimated total sequestered carbon (C) and its equivalent in carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2\text{e}$), which is a key metric for climate reporting.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the calculation script:

1.  Make sure you have **Python** installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python carbon-calculation.py
    ```
